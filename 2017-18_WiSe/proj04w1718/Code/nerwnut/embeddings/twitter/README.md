This zip contains a word2vec model trained on Twitter data as described in:

Godin, F., Vandersmissen, B., De Neve, W., & Van de Walle, R. (2015).
Multimedia Lab @ ACL W-NUT NER shared task: Named entity recognition for Twitter microposts using distributed word representations.
Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text, ACL 2015.

Please cite the paper if you use the model.

This zip contains 2 additional files to read the word2vec model with Python.
The code for this was extracted from the Gensim Library which can be found here: https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html
The only difference is that it does not use a strict encoding to read the model from the file.
(One can easily integrate, inherit or extend the library or the Python files)

The pre-trained Twitter word embeddings used in this project were taken from (http://www.fredericgodin.com/software/) 
and properly cited as the author requires it.
