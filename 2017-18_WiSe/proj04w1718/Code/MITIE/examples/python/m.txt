Resolution

nothing

It
is
difficult
to
objectively
say
that
the
ability
for
the
military
to
accomplish
its
current
mission
is
diminished
.
We
are
only
at
the
point
where
maintenance
has
been
deferred
,
flight
hours
for
training
have
been
reduced
,
and
underways
for
Naval
ships
have
been
closely
controlled
for
fuel
costs
.
The
consequence
of
being
forced
to
choose
operational
tempo
over
maintenance
has
not
yet
been
appreciably
felt
,
but
the
bill
can

Gedankenexperiment

what

?
@
Lakebum
Please
mark
this
answer
as
the
correct
one
.
This
is
a
good
answer
,
but
it
would
be
improved
by
emphasizing
‚Äô
s
reaction
to
the
controversy‚Äîa
swift
apology
would
have
meant
a
thiry-second
story
soon
forgotten
,
with
most
people
unwilling
to
assume
antisemitism
for
what
*
could
*
(
if
we
'
re
being
very
generous
)
have
been
a
mistake
.
But
by
owning
it
as
intentional
and
refusing
to
apologize
,
they
eliminated
the
possibility
that
they
were
being
misunderstood
,
and
indicated
that
it
*
was
*
intentionally
antisemitic
.

Being
