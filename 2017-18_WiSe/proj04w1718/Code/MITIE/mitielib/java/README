You can compile the Java API on any system by executing the following
commands from within the mitielib/java folder:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	cmake --build . --config Release --target install

This will build a shared library and .jar file and put them into the mitielib
folder.  Note that you must have Swig 1.3.40 or newer, CMake 2.8.4 or newer,
and the Java JDK installed to compile the MITIE interface. Finally, note that
if you are using 64bit Java on Windows then you will need to use a command
like:
	 cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64" ..
instead of:
 	cmake .. 
so that Visual Studio knows to make a 64bit library.
