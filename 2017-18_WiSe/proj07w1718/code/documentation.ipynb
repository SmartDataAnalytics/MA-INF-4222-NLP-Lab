    "## Motivation\n",
    "Deep generative models has been very popular recently in both theory and application due to its versatility. They have been successfully applied for image-to-image translation, image super-resolution, and style transfer, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/pix2pix.png\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Two of the most popular flavours of deep generative models are Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE). They are approaching the problem of generative modeling from different perspectives and methods. However, recently there is a work that show the unified view of GAN and VAE. GAN approach the problem of generative modeling from game theoritic point of view, that is, finding the optimal approximate data distribution is equivalent to finding Nash Equilibrium. Meanwhile, VAE approaches generative modeling from statistical point of view, with the principle of Variational Inference that comes from statistical physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "GAN and VAE has been very popular in recent years in vision domain. This popularity mainly attributed to the fact that GAN and VAE are readily available to be applied in continuous domain like images. Many works have been released in vision domain, e.g.. However, GAN and VAE have been sparsely used for problems in text domain. This underusage is attributed to the fact that text is discrete in its nature, and thus harder to be applied with GAN or VAE, as they are both rely on backpropagation which requires gradients of their parameters, which only available in continuous function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, there have been some effort to incorporate GAN and VAE for textual data. In this project, we are implementing a model called _Conditional Generation of Text (CGT)_ by Hu, et. al., 2017, in which GAN and VAE are combined together to enable text generation conditioned to some labels, e.g. sentiment."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative Models\n",
    "Generative modeling is density estimation problem, i.e. given data samples or empirical distribution, we are interested to find the true distribution of those samples. This is often intractable task, thus we need some sort of approximation. We can do this by using maximum likelihood principle which says that the best approximated distribution is the one that most likely generates these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/mle.png\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a generative model, as it estimates the $p(\\mathcal{X})$, i.e. the true data distribution, by sampling from it, we can get new data. This motivates the application of generative models for semi-supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will review the high level idea of GAN and VAE to provide necessary background for this report. We refer interested readers into Goodfellow, 2016 for detailed survey about generative modeling and especially GAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a generative models that uses approach from game theory. The basic idea of GAN is to have two players game where those players are neural networks. First network is called the **generator** and the second network is called the **discriminator**. The discriminator's job is to examine data samples, whether they are fake or real. The generator's job meanwhile is to fool the discriminator, i.e. generates new samples that are very realistic so that discriminator misclassify them as real. Drawing analogy from money counterfeiter (generator) and police (discriminator), the counterfeiter has to fool the police by creating fake money that are indistinguishible from the real money. Meanwhile the police's job is to make sure that counterfeited money will not circulated in public, thus the police needs to be able to do good job in classifying between real and fake money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, GAN consists of two functions: discriminator function $D$ and generator function $G$. $D$ takes data $\\mathbf{x}$ as inputs and has parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta^D}$. The generator function $G$ takes latent variables $\\mathbf{z}$ as inputs and has parameters $\\mathbf{\\theta^G}$. In practice both $D$ and $G$ are both deep neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both players in GAN has their own objective, denoted in their cost functions. The discriminator's job is to minimize $J^D(\\mathbf{\\theta^D}, \\mathbf{\\theta^G})$ while only modifying $\\mathbf{\\theta^D}$. Likewise, the generator's job is to minimize $J^G(\\mathbf{\\theta^D}, \\mathbf{\\theta^G})$ while only modifying $\\mathbf{\\theta^G}$. Thus, each players cannot control behavior of other player. The solution of this optimization problem is then a Nash Equilibrium. The overall cost function of this game is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\min_G \\max_D V(D, G) = \\mathbb{E}_{x \\sim p_{\\text{data}}(x)}[\\log D(x)] + \\mathbb{E}_{z \\sim p_{z}(z)}[\\log (1 - D(G(z)))].\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variational Autoencoder (VAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is another class of approaching the problem of generative modeling. Unlike GAN which uses game theoritic approach, VAE borrows its idea from statistical physics. Concretely, VAE uses mean-field theorem to formulate mean-field variational inference for generative modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like GAN, VAE consists of two parametric functions, which in this case are deep neural networks. The first network is the recognition or inference network $Q(z \\vert x)$ which takes data $x$ as inputs and maps them into the latent variables $z$. The second network is the generative network $P(x \\vert z)$ which takes latent variables as inputs and generates data. Notice that the formulation of VAE is very similar to classical autoencoder (AE), hence the name.\n",
    "\n",
    "VAE differs from AE in the way the hidden or latent variables $z$ is represented. In VAE $z$ are stochastic variables, and the hidden units of $z$ are encoded by a distribution. In practice, this distribution is diagonal Gaussian.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall cost function of VAE is the combination of reconstruction cost and hidden units cost. Reconstruction cost in VAE is analogue to that in AE. The hidden units cost, which minimize KL-Divergence between posterior $Q(z \\vert x)$ and prior $P(z)$ can be seen as a regularization for the hidden units of the autoencoder. Thus the total cost of VAE is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  \\log P(x) \\geq \\mathbb{E}[\\log P(x \\vert z)] - D_{KL}[Q(z \\vert x) \\Vert P(z)] .\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, VAE circumvents the intractability of $P(\\mathcal{X})$ by optimizing its lower bound instead. The name of variational comes from the fact that this lower bound comes by applying mean-field variational inference. This lower bound will not exactly fit the target distribution, but we hope that it will be a good approximation of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/main-figure0.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative Models for Text\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative modeling, unlike in vision domain, is largely still in infancy. This is due to the nature of textual data, i.e. texts are discrete and in Deep Learning, we prefer everything to be continuous as it is easier to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the difficulty of generative modeling on text, consider a GAN. Consider GAN loss defined above, we can see that the output of generator $G$, which in this case text, will be fed into $D$. During the backpropagation then, to get the gradient of $G$, we have to backpropagate from the output of $D$ to $G$ via the output of $G$. As this output is discrete, then the gradient is undefined and thus breaks backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some tricks that can be used to avoid this pitfall. For example, we can use softmax trick using temperature to do continuous approximation of argmax or even considering this problem from Reinforcement Learning perspective.\n"

    "In this project we worked on conditional generation of text, following a paper by Hu, 2017. With this model, we combine together two of the most popular generative models: GAN and VAE. The base VAE model is following a model by Bowman, 2016, and we put a discriminator on top of that to enforce conditional label in the text generation. We are able to train this model by using some tricks, namely KL-cost annealing, word dropout, and also soft embedding. With these tricks, training for base VAE is stabilized and the problem with nondifferentiability of textual data is alleviated when training the discriminator."
