It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents. Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease. But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease. All the more so as for an adequate profit the rental rate as compared to the base rent need not be raised for every new lease.
