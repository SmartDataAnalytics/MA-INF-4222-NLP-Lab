A violation of international law should be more than enough to consider a reaction! Humanity has made enough mistakes throughout history by waiting too long, and when it has finally reacted, the only remaining option has usually been war. It's to be noted that in our civilized world, in a democratic country, the people can determine their own fate, as long as the motivation of those people isn't triggered by propaganda, corruption and military pressure. Since, however, in Russia besides gas and oil only propaganda and corruption rule, the EU should intervene right away.
