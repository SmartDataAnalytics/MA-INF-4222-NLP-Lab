There should be much higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements. Stepping in dog dirt is gross and absolutely ruins your day due to the dirt, the stench and the often considerable effort to get rid of it. Besides, the fines for public urination by a human are higher than for leaving behind dog dirt on the pavement, which is disproportionate. Some dog owners assume that paying a dog licence fee covers the removal of such waste, but according to this logic one could hardly make the taxpayer accountable for almost any offense.
