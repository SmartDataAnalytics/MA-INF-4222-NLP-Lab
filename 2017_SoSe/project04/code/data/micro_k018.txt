Our society is in danger of overheating due to 'never clocking off'. Even though politicians stress the Christian character of our country, the last 20 years have seen the Sunday off work increasingly sacrificed to commerce.

That's why there ought to be one day a week when supermarkets and shopping centres stay closed.
