If there were higher fines for leaving dog dirt on pavements, there would presumably be less dog dirt, which in turn would result in generally clean pavements. Higher fines may not be ideal, particularly for financially weaker individuals, but cleaning up after their dogs does happen to be the obligation of the owners.
