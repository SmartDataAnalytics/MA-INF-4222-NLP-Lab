Tuition fees should not generally be charged by universities. Universities are for all citizens, independent of their finances. Education and training are fundamental rights which the state, the society must provide. If a university lacks the funds, sponsors must be found. Unfortunately this can lead to disagreeable dependencies in some cases.
