For years there has been a housing shortage in Berlin, so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea. Since the area belongs to the federal state, or the federation, it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents. Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners, especially in spring and summer. If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing, then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction.
