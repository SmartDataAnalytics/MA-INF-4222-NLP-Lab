Rent prices are already regulated in favour of tenants due to existing laws and the rent index. In view of the high prices for buying flats with existing rent contracts, these are an unattractive investment. Even if one might think that additional rent control is needed besides the current tenant protection, one should not deny longstanding owners the opportunity to adjust their returns to market level. A cap on rent increases upon tenant change is therefore not to be supported.
