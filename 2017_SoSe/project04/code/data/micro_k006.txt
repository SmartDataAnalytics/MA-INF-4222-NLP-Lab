If Germany were to introduce the death penalty, convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies. However, a death would not be of any more use to those affected and their relatives than if the felon receives a long sentence. Plus we don't live in medieval times anymore. Handing out capital punishment is unethical. We don't need it.
