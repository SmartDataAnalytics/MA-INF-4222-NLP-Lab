No one should have the possibility to pick up the morning-after pill over the counter at the pharmacy. Though there'd be the advantage of forgoing the embarrassment of a visit to the doctor or a nighttime trip to the walk-in clinic, women should still be informed about the risks and have a gynaecological examination before taking it. Furthermore there's the risk that women could use the over-the-counter morning-after pill as a substitute for contraception.
