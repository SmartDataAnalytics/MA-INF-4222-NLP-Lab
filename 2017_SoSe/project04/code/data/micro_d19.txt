A bank bailout is very, very costly. For instance, the taxpayer stood in for the failed bank 'Hypo Real Estate' with a three-figure billion amount. That's why we should not allow any additional bank rescues. The politicians are trying to appease us with the fact that actually only a tiny amount of all that money was really spent. But even with that tiny amount you could do a lot of good elsewhere.
