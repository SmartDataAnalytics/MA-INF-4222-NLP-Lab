The TV/radio licence fee can only be required of all citizens/households equally. Critics point out that they are not using what's on offer by public broadcasting. I do doubt that there is anyone who has never at least indirectly watched the programming of the public broadcasters. However, it is impossible to monitor this and collect more customized fees. Just as with other choices in culture or infrastructure, public broadcasters are also to be financed, regardless of whether individuals make use of their programming or not.
