I think Berlin with its two inner-city airports was lucky not having to experience an airplane catastrophe for decades. For safety reasons alone I find continued operation wrong. Also, Berlin urgently needs inner-city areas for business and industry, and for housing. Closing down Tegel will have health benefits for hundreds of thousands in the approach path. These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors (housing health and employment). After the new BER Airport has been commissioned, Tegel should definitely be closed.
