School uniforms should not be worn in our schools. They do offer the benefit that the competition over brand-name clothes and the discrimination of the socially weak are prevented. Nevertheless hardly anyone wishes to dress themselves or their children in a standard uniform. Plus such uniforms also stand for ideological conformity and for the suppression of individual self-development.
