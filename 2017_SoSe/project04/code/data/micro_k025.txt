Capital punishment is not a solution, as it cannot be ruled out that the judicial process may make mistakes. Criminals should not be put in luxury prisons, though. After all there are criminals who enjoy 'living' in prison for its decent board, no taxes to be paid, no stress with work. Still, the state needs the death penalty as a deterrent to horrific crimes.
