I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years. This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future. The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire. This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period. The danger here is that experienced junior staff is not available in sufficient numbers.
