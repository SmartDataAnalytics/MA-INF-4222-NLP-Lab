Actually only those people should pay a TV & radio licence fee who really watch ARD, ZDF, Arte etc. It is in fact good to support sophisticated programming through fees. Curiously, however, there are still adverts and product placements on the public channels. What are you paying for, then? That the same actors time and again get to have a laugh at exotic shooting locations? Also the scripts are often copied off each other.
