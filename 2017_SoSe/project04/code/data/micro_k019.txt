The thought of television exclusively made up of private channels scares me. Admittedly trash and turmoil are exactly what the majority of people want to see. But to therefore offer TV according to audience rates only would be dangerous. Only in public TV programmes can viewers get information that is not profit-oriented. And since it is the duty of society to collectively finance certain areas that cannot hold their own in a market economy, everyone should chip in.
