It is quite clear that Sunday should remain a day of rest. For you can go shopping 6 days a week, as shops are open till 10pm on some days. Thus Sundays should remain a day for getting together with family, otherwise there will be a new kind of leisure activity where people spend their time in supermarkets instead of outside or in conversation etc. Furthermore, there's no need to keep shops open on Sundays.
