Many people see proven relief of their symptoms and complaints by complementary medicine. However there is no substantiated data that this healing isn't simply due to the placebo effect. Besides many practices in this field are not regulated professions, which means that quacks and phonies can practice these occupations unknown to the patients. That's why the statutory health insurance companies should not cover such treatments. It would be conceivable to invest more into the training and control of this occupation sector on the part of the state.
