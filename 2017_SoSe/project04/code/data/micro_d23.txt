Tomorrow I will skydive for the first time in my life. Yes, there is a certain risk to life. But I want to experience this incredible moment of freedom that skydivers report time and again. Besides, Jochen was given a parachute jump the other day as a gift, and it mustn't be that this wannabe-adventurer has one up on me.
