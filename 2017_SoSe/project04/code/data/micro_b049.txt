The bachelor thesis reflects both the content and the methods of the topics covered during a degree programme. But one can make occasional mistakes in the thesis. If this carries more weight, many good individual assignments done during the course of study may be obscured. A good grade for the thesis also significantly depends on the supervision of a dedicated teacher. Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role.
