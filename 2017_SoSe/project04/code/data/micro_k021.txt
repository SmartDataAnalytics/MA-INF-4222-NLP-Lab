'Property entails commitment' is one of the tenets of our social order. Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property. A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone, however, will lead to a further division of society. The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods. A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society.
