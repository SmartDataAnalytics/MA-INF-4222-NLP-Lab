One can hardly move in Friedrichshain or Neuk√∂lln these days without permanently scanning the ground for dog dirt. And when bad luck does strike and you step into one of the many 'land mines' you have to painstakingly scrape the remains off your soles. Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent, lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners. Of course, first they'd actually need to be caught in the act by public order officers, but once they have to dig into their pockets, their laziness will sure vanish!
