The death penalty should be abandoned everywhere. From a Christian and humanistic perspective it is not allowed to kill someone. Proponents of the death penalty count on its deterring effect as well as the ultimate elimination of any potential threat. However also the threat of the death penalty in the respective countries apparently cannot prevent murder and violent crime. Moreover it turns out time and again that innocent people are also convicted and executed.
