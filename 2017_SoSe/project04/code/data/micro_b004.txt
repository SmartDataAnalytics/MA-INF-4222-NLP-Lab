Of course there are a number of programmes in public broadcasting that are not worth the licencing fee, and others, such as “Musikantenstadl” and soap operas, are only interesting to certain audiences. Nevertheless, everybody should contribute to the funding of the public broadcasters in equal measure, for we need general and independent media. After all we want to get our view of the world neither through the lens of the government nor through that of rich media entrepreneurs.
