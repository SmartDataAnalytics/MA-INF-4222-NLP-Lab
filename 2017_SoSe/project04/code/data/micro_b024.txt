A stop must be put to exorbitant rents by imposing a limit on rent increases when changing residences. For affordable living space is scarce. Besides, a higher degree of luxury (expensive flats) is not necessary for the majority of the people, but rather a flat at all. Plus everyone has to move approx. 3-10 times in his or her life, because the size of the desired accommodation changes over the course of a lifetime.
