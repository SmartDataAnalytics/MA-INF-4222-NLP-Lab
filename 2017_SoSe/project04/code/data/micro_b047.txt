The morning-after pill has a number of side effects. A differentiated analysis of its side effects is not achievable for a layperson without medical advice. However these are clearly stated on the package insert, and a request for an early termination of a pregnancy is the right of every woman. The morning-after pill should only be prescribed after counselling by a physician or pharmacist.
