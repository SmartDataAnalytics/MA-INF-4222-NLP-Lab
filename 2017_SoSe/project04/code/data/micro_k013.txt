Supermarket employees and people who work in shopping centres also have the right to a Sunday off work. Likewise public holidays should remain what they are: for some a day of introspection, for others a paid day off that is not taken away from the annual paid leave proper. Hence it is good when shops are not open on Sundays and public holidays. People, however, who work during the week and on Saturdays then have a problem: everyone else can shop weekdays, but they can't. For those people the late opening hours, which meanwhile already extend to 12:00 midnight, present a good alternative.
