Of course it would be nice and simple if after a fun night out with a party acquaintance you could simply take the 'morning-after pill' and feel at ease. But it's not that simple. Perhaps a new life was already created that night. I would kill it without further thought. That's why a visit to the doctor and professional advice should remain mandatory.
