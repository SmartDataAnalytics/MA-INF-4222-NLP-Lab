Well, I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends. Sure, other people have to work in the shops on the weekend, but they can have days off during the week and run errands at their leisure while I'm stuck in the office. Plus, the state wants me to spend my money, and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren't open when I'm off work?
