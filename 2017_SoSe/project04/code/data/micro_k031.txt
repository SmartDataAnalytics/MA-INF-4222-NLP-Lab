Pieces of dog poo on the pavements are a real danger. Time and again children or the elderly slip on them. A fine for leaving dog waste behind admittedly seems rather authoritarian, but similar rules are often in place for bicycles on park paths, after all. Increasing penalties is therefore the right way. A dog dirt-free city will be more attractive not only for its residents but also for tourists!
