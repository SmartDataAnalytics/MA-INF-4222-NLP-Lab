Berlin's basketball team has just come out of a sobering season. Especially the home games have seen the team stay behind expectations. A sad highlight: Losing 60:87 to the weakish Mannheimers in a sold-out stadium. Indeed the team ended up third in the league, but given the cost of the star-players one could've expected more.
