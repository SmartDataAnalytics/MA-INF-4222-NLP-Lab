Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open on any Sundays and holidays. This may be a change for the employees that cannot to be implemented easily. However, especially for working customers this would mean greater flexibility and fewer nerve-racking peak times during the week. Considering the growing digitization of society, the traditional model of the weekend will soon be obsolete. Many European countries, for instance the Netherlands, Sweden and Great Britain, have already understood this and successfully adjusted the opening hours for retailers.
