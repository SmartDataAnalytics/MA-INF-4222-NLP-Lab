Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment. However it's mainly temps (that is, students, pupils etc.) who are employed, so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed. On top of that, private and family life suffers massively because of this reduction and shifting in designated off-times. And itâ€™s only the large companies that can afford the additional personnel expenditure. For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.
