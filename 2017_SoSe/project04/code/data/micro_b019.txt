It is desirable that no one channels his or her wealth past the tax authorities. Those who do or try to should be held accountable if at all possible. Having said that, state funds are often wasted on nonsensical investments, so that this ideal appears unworthy of support in many ways. Besides, the trading of information is obviously driven by greed of gain. Tax data that are not made available for free should therefore not be acquired by the state.
